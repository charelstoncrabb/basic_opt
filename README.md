Basic C++ optimization library

Currently enclosed is a basic C++ optimization library intended for simple optimization problems.
The library currently contains single- and multi-variate gradient descent algorithm implementations, 
with a basic unit test in maintest.cpp (also included in the <A HREF="https://charelstoncrabb.github.io/basic_opt/html/index.html">documentation</A>).

The technical roadmap for this library includes eventually allowing for efficient solutions to artificial neural network training.

Open-source contributions are welcome.

This library is intended to provide a simple, user-\/friendly C++ black-\/box optimization library. ~\newline
 The current user-\/interface is through a single header file \mbox{\hyperlink{opt_8h_source}{opt.\+h}}. ~\newline
 ~\newline
 The optimization functions are within the \href{https://charelstoncrabb.github.io/basic_opt/html/namespaceopt.html}{\tt opt} namespace. ~\newline
 Currently implemented is a simple \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent}{\tt gradient descent method} for single-\/ or multi-\/variate functions, as well as the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_conjugate_gradient_method}{\tt non-\/linear conjugate gradient version}. ~\newline
 Up next, writing \href{http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page}{\tt Eigen}-\/friendly implementations of these optimization methods.

This library is intended to provide a simple, user-\/friendly C++ black-\/box optimization library. The current user-\/interface is through a single header file \mbox{\hyperlink{opt_8h_source}{opt.\+h}}. The optimization functions are within in the {\bfseries opt} namespace. Currently implemented is a simple \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent}{\tt gradient descent method} for single-\/ or multi-\/variate functions. Up next, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method}{\tt conjugate gradient methods}. The technical roadmap for this project includes writing an optimization library wrapper for the \href{http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page}{\tt Eigen} linear algebra library.
